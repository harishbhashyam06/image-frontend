- **Greyscale Filter**: Converts the image to greyscale.
- **Sepia Filter**: Applies a sepia tone filter to the image.
- **Color Correct Image**: Performs color correction on the image.

### 3. Brightness Adjustment
- **Brighten Image**: Increases the brightness of the image by a specified factor.
- **Darken Image**: Decreases the brightness of the image by a specified factor.

### 4. Image Compression
- **Compress Image**: Compresses the image by reducing its quality.

### 5. Color Space Operations
- **Luma Component Image**: Extracts the luma component of the image.
- **Value Component Image**: Extracts the value component of the image.
- **Intensity Component Image**: Extracts the intensity component of the image.

### 6. Adjust Color Levels

- **Flip Horizontally**: Flips the image horizontally.

## Usage

To apply an operation to an image, click on the corresponding icon in the grid. Some operations may require additional input, such as brightness adjustment or color level adjustment. In such cases, a popup will appear allowing the user to specify the parameters before applying the operation.

## Notes
